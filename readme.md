<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Sup! I'm SSHCredentials!</h1>

I do alot of stuff with Docker, Linux, and firewalls. Mainly messing around with the Pterodactyl Software and seeing what's possible and what I've broken (ðŸ˜‚), however I also do make Minecraft servers as a hobby; from coding in Skript, to actually maintaining the server through making sure there isn't too much storage being taken up, optimising the server for better performance, and also protecting it from any attacks or malicious people. You may see me around in the free Minecraft server hosting community, if you do, don't be afraid to say hi (I don't bite)! If you would like to contact me, you can do so through either Discord or email me at hello@sshcredentials.live
